House Price Prediction â€” Simple Linear Regression

This project uses simple linear regression to predict housing prices based solely on lot area using Python and the scikit-learn library. It visualizes the relationship between lot size and sale price, fits a linear model, and outputs predictions on test data.

Goal: Predict house sale price based on LotArea
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
Output: Scatter plot with regression line and printed predictions
